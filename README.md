# Spatial
A library for spatial data structures and related functions.

## TODO:
- Implement overlap + encompassing functions for mixture of Ball + Box volumes.
- Add support for collision detection to SquareTree.
Can assume that all bodies stored in the tree are static initially (but the query body may be moving).
